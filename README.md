# Akvesoi

Akvesoi is a custom build version of [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/). 

Main modifications include:
- Default width being 600
- Some particular character variants
- Four sub-fonts for different use cases

The four sub-fonts are:
- Akvesoi Code, with spacing being `default` (some symbols are wider), discretionary ligations, intended to be used in GUI code editors
- Akvesoi Term, with spacing being `term` (the symbols' width are suitable for terminal emulators), just enough ligations, intended to be used in terminal
- Akvesoi Mono, with spacing being `fixed` (every non-combining characters having the same width), no ligations, intended to be used in strict monospace occasions
- Akvesoi Type, with spacing being `quasi-proportional-extension-only` (quasi-proportional but only wide letters like M and W will get expanded, inspired by [iA Writer Duo](https://ia.net/topics/in-search-of-the-perfect-writing-font)), intended to be used for creative writing

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/g-hanwen/Akvesoi/releases) page to download built fonts. The version numbers follow Iosevka.
